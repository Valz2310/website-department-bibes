    <p>Biomedical engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies engineering principles to biology and medicine to improve human health, creating devices like pacemakers and prosthetics, developing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic systems through technologies such as AI and wearables.</p>
    <p>This field combines aspects of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mechanical</li>
      <li>Electrical</li>
      <li>Chemical</li>
      <li>Materials Engineering</li>
    </ol>
    <p>...with biology and medicine to solve problems in healthcare, focusing on designing new technologies and improving existing ones for patient care and treatment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>After five years of intense education, the Biomedical Engineering graduate has, at their disposal, a wide range of career opportunities such as employment as a Biomedical Engineer, Clinical Engineer, Service Engineer, Customer Support Engineer, Application Specialist, Engineer (Medical Devices), Patent Examiner, Biomedical Auditor or a Content Developer.</p>
    <p>The programme is designed with a huge focus on heritage-based education, creativity, and expansible techno-preneurship to enable graduates to initiate scalable business enterprises.</p>
