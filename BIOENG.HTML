<body><p>Biomedical engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies engineering principles to biology and medicine to improve human health , creating devices like pacemakers and prosthetics, developing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic systems through technologies such as AI and wearables.<br>
     This field combines aspects of <OL><li>mechanical</li><LI> electrical</LI><li> chemical</li><li>materials engineering </li></OL>with biology and medicine to solve problems in healthcare focusing on designing new technologies and improving existing ones for patient care and treatment.</p> 
<p2>After five years of intense education, the Biomedical Engineering graduate has, at their disposal, a wide range of career opportunities such as employment as a Biomedical Engineer, Clinical Engineer, Service Engineer, Customer Support Engineer, Application Specialist, Engineer (Medical Devices), Patent Examiner, Biomedical Auditor or a Content Developer.<BR>  
        The programme is designed with a huge focus on heritage-based education creativity and expansible techno-prenuership to enable graduates to initiate scalable business enterprises.</p2>
